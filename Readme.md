## üìã Course Structure and Preparation

Before diving into this roadmap, here's a suggested course structure:

1. **Daily Learning**: Dedicate time each day to go through the topics and complete the exercises.
2. **Hands-On Practice**: Apply what you learn by working on coding exercises and mini-projects.
3. **Revision**: Regularly review previous days' content to reinforce your knowledge.
4. **Exploration**: Beyond this roadmap, explore other Python libraries and projects that interest you.

By following this structured approach, you'll gradually build your Python proficiency and gain confidence in your programming skills.
