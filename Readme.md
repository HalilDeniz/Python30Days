## How to Use

The learning materials for each day are contained in separate files in the project's root directory. To navigate to a specific day, you can either look at the filenames or refer to the content in the main "README.md" file.

For example, to access the content for [Day 4-6](Days-4-6.md), you can check the " [Day 4-6.md](Days-4-6.md)" file.

## Content
The project is divided into the following sections:

**[Days 1-3](Days-1-3.md): Basic Concepts and Installation**
- Understand the introduction and why Python is popular.
- Learn the basic syntax of Python and its data types (string, integer, float, list, tuple, dictionary).
- Install Python on your computer.

**[Days 4-6](Days-4-6.md): Conditional Statements and Loops**
- Learn conditional statements (if, elif, else) and logical operators.
- Understand and use loops (for and while).

**[Days 7-10](Days-7-10.md): Data Structures**
- Deepen your knowledge of data structures like lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
- Practice working with data structures.

**[Days 11-14](Days-11-14.md): Functions and Modules**
- Define and use functions in Python.
- Use basic Python modules (math, random, datetime).

**[Days 15-18](Days-15-18.md): File Handling and Error Handling**
- Learn about file reading and writing.
- Understand error handling (try-except).

**[Days 19-22](Days-19-22.md): Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- Understand classes and objects.
- Learn OOP concepts (inheritance, polymorphism).

**[Days 23-26](Days-23-26.md): Database Connection and SQL**
- Establish a connection with a database (e.g., SQLite).
- Learn basic SQL queries.

**[Days 27-30](Days-27-30.md): Web Development and Frameworks**
- Explore Python web frameworks like Flask or Django.
- Create a simple web application.

The content for each day is elaborated in detail within the respective day's file.

##
This roadmap will help you rapidly acquire fundamental Python skills. However, you can extend your learning time for a more in-depth understanding of Python and working on more complex projects. As you progress, you can tailor Python to your specific interests and work on more advanced projects.
