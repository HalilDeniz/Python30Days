### **Day 19: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that uses objects to represent real-world entities.

- **Classes and Objects:**
  - Classes define blueprints for creating objects.
  - Objects are instances of classes.
- **Attributes and Methods:**
  - Classes can have attributes (data) and methods (functions) that define their properties and behavior.

**Example of creating a simple class and an object:**
```python
# Define a simple class
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def bark(self):
        print(f"{self.name} says woof!")

# Create an object (instance) of the Dog class
my_dog = Dog("Buddy")
my_dog.bark()  # Call the bark method on the object
```

### **Day 20: Class Attributes and Methods**
Classes can have attributes and methods that define their behavior.

- **Class Attributes:**
  - Class attributes are shared among all instances of the class.
- **Instance Attributes:**
  - Instance attributes are specific to individual objects.
- **Methods:**
  - Methods are functions defined within a class.

**Example of class attributes and methods:**
```python
class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14159 * self.radius**2

    def circumference(self):
        return 2 * 3.14159 * self.radius

my_circle = Circle(5)
print(f"Area: {my_circle.area()}")
print(f"Circumference: {my_circle.circumference()}")
```

### **Day 21: Inheritance**
Inheritance allows you to create new classes that inherit attributes and methods from existing classes.

- **Parent Class (Superclass):**
  - The parent class defines common attributes and methods.
- **Child Class (Subclass):**
  - The child class inherits from the parent class and can have additional attributes and methods.

**Example of inheritance:**
```python
# Parent class
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        pass

# Child class inheriting from Animal
class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"

my_dog = Dog("Buddy")
print(my_dog.speak())  # Calls the speak method of the Dog class
```

### **Day 22: Polymorphism**
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.

- **Common Superclass:**
  - Create a common superclass that defines shared methods or attributes.
- **Subclasses with Different Implementations:**
  - Subclasses provide their own implementations of methods.

**Example of polymorphism:**
```python
# Common superclass
class Shape:
    def area(self):
        pass

# Subclasses with different implementations of area
class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14159 * self.radius**2

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

shapes = [Circle(5), Rectangle(4, 6)]

for shape in shapes:
    print(f"Area: {shape.area()}")
```

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a fundamental concept in Python and many other programming languages. It allows you to model real-world entities, promote code organization, and enhance code reusability. Practice with these examples to become proficient in using OOP principles in Python.
