**Day 19: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that uses objects to represent real-world entities.
- In Python, everything is an object.

**Example of creating a simple class and an object:**
```python
# Define a simple class
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def bark(self):
        print(f"{self.name} says woof!")

# Create an object (instance) of the Dog class
my_dog = Dog("Buddy")
my_dog.bark()  # Call the bark method on the object
```

**Day 20: Class Attributes and Methods**
- Classes can have attributes (data) and methods (functions) that define their behavior.
- You can access attributes and call methods on objects.

**Example of class attributes and methods:**
```python
class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14159 * self.radius**2

    def circumference(self):
        return 2 * 3.14159 * self.radius

my_circle = Circle(5)
print(f"Area: {my_circle.area()}")
print(f"Circumference: {my_circle.circumference()}")
```

**Day 21: Inheritance**
- Inheritance allows you to create a new class that is a modified version of an existing class (parent class).
- The new class inherits the attributes and methods of the parent class.

**Example of inheritance:**
```python
# Parent class
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        pass

# Child class inheriting from Animal
class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"

my_dog = Dog("Buddy")
print(my_dog.speak())  # Calls the speak method of the Dog class
```

**Day 22: Polymorphism**
- Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
- It simplifies code and promotes code reusability.

**Example of polymorphism:**
```python
# Common superclass
class Shape:
    def area(self):
        pass

# Subclasses with different implementations of area
class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14159 * self.radius**2

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

shapes = [Circle(5), Rectangle(4, 6)]

for shape in shapes:
    print(f"Area: {shape.area()}")
```

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a fundamental concept in Python and many other programming languages. It allows you to model real-world entities, promote code organization, and enhance code reusability. Practice with these examples to become proficient in using OOP principles in Python.
