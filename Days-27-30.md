**Day 27: Introduction to Web Development**
- Web development involves creating websites and web applications.
- Python can be used for web development with the help of web frameworks like Flask or Django.

**Day 28: Flask - Creating a Basic Web Application**
- Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python.
- You can create a basic web application with Flask.

**Example of a basic Flask web application:**
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

**Day 29: Flask - Adding Routes and Templates**
- Flask uses routes to map URLs to view functions.
- You can use templates to generate dynamic HTML content.

**Example of adding routes and using templates in Flask:**
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return 'Home Page'

@app.route('/about')
def about():
    return 'About Us'

@app.route('/contact')
def contact():
    return 'Contact Us'

@app.route('/profile/<username>')
def profile(username):
    return render_template('profile.html', username=username)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

**Day 30: Flask - Handling Forms and Data**
- Web applications often require handling user input through forms.
- You can use Flask to create forms and handle form data.

**Example of handling forms in Flask:**
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/submit', methods=['POST'])
def submit():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        name = request.form['name']
        email = request.form['email']
        return f'Thank you, {name}, for submitting your email: {email}'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

Web development is a vast field, and Flask is an excellent starting point for building web applications with Python. However, for more extensive and feature-rich applications, you may consider learning Django, another popular Python web framework. These examples provide a foundation for creating web applications and handling user interactions using Flask. You can continue to explore and expand your web development skills from here.
