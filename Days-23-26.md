**Day 23: Database Connection**
- Python can connect to various types of databases using different database libraries.
- One common library for working with databases in Python is `sqlite3` for SQLite databases.

**Example of connecting to an SQLite database:**
```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to a database (creates a new one if it doesn't exist)
conn = sqlite3.connect("my_database.db")

# Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Close the connection when done
conn.close()
```

**Day 24: Creating Tables and Inserting Data**
- You can create tables in a database and insert data into them using SQL commands.
- The `execute()` method is used to run SQL queries.

**Example of creating a table and inserting data:**
```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect("my_database.db")
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Create a table
cursor.execute("""
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS students (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
        name TEXT,
        age INTEGER
    )
""")

# Insert data into the table
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO students (name, age) VALUES (?, ?)", ("Alice", 25))
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO students (name, age) VALUES (?, ?)", ("Bob", 30))

# Commit the changes and close the connection
conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

**Day 25: Querying Data**
- You can retrieve data from a database table using SQL SELECT queries.
- The `fetchall()` method retrieves all rows from a query.

**Example of querying data from a table:**
```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect("my_database.db")
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Query data from the table
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM students")
students = cursor.fetchall()

# Print the results
for student in students:
    print(f"ID: {student[0]}, Name: {student[1]}, Age: {student[2]}")

conn.close()
```

**Day 26: Updating and Deleting Data**
- You can use SQL UPDATE and DELETE queries to modify or remove data from a database table.
- Be cautious when performing updates or deletions.

**Example of updating and deleting data:**
```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect("my_database.db")
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Update data
cursor.execute("UPDATE students SET age = 26 WHERE name = 'Alice'")

# Delete data
cursor.execute("DELETE FROM students WHERE name = 'Bob'")

# Commit the changes and close the connection
conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

Understanding how to work with databases and SQL in Python is crucial for many real-world applications where data storage and retrieval are required. The `sqlite3` library is suitable for learning and small-scale projects, but for larger databases, you may consider other database systems like MySQL or PostgreSQL. Practice with these examples to become proficient in database operations in Python.
