**Day 15: File Handling**
- File handling in Python allows you to read from and write to files.
- You can use the `open()` function to interact with files.

**Example of reading from a file:**
```python
# Open a file for reading
file = open("example.txt", "r")

# Read the contents of the file
content = file.read()
print(content)

# Close the file
file.close()
```

**Example of writing to a file:**
```python
# Open a file for writing
file = open("example.txt", "w")

# Write content to the file
file.write("Hello, Python!")

# Close the file
file.close()
```

**Day 16: File Modes and Context Managers**
- File modes (e.g., "r" for read, "w" for write) determine how the file is opened.
- Context managers (with statement) simplify file handling and ensure file closure.

**Example of using a context manager to read a file:**
```python
# Using a context manager to automatically close the file
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

**Day 17: Error Handling (Try-Except Blocks)**
- Error handling allows you to gracefully handle exceptions and errors in your code.
- You can use `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks to manage errors.

**Example of handling an exception:**
```python
try:
    num = int("abc")  # This will raise a ValueError
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

**Day 18: Error Handling (Multiple Exceptions and Custom Exceptions)**
- You can handle multiple exceptions with multiple `except` blocks.
- You can create custom exceptions by defining new exception classes.

**Example of handling multiple exceptions and creating a custom exception:**
```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print(f"Division by zero error: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

# Custom exception
class MyCustomError(Exception):
    pass

try:
    raise MyCustomError("This is a custom error.")
except MyCustomError as e:
    print(f"Custom error caught: {e}")
```

Understanding file handling and error handling is essential for robust and reliable Python programming. These skills help you work with files and gracefully handle errors that may occur during the execution of your code. Practice with these examples to become proficient in file handling and error handling in Python.
