**Day 1: Introduction to Python**
- Python is a high-level programming language.
- It's known for its readability and simplicity.
- Python code is executed line by line.
- Example:
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

**Day 2: Variables and Data Types**
- Variables are used to store data.
- Common data types include strings, integers, floats, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
- Example:
```python
name = "John"
age = 30
height = 6.1
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
```

**Day 3: Conditional Statements and Loops**
- Conditional statements allow you to make decisions in your code.
- `if`, `elif`, and `else` are used for branching.
- Loops like `for` and `while` are used for repetitive tasks.
- Example:
```python
# Conditional statement
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
elif x == 5:
    print("x is equal to 5")
else:
    print("x is less than 5")

# For loop
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# While loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

Remember to run these examples in a Python environment. You can install Python on your computer by downloading it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once installed, you can use a code editor or Python's built-in IDLE to write and run Python code.

These examples should give you a good start in understanding basic Python concepts and how to run Python code.
